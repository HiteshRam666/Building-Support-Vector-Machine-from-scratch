SVM Classifier

Equation of the Hyperplane:
y = wx - b

Gradient Descent:
Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used for minimizing the loss function in various machine learning algorithms. It is used for updating the parameters of the learning model.

w = w - α*dw

b = b - α*db

Learning Rate:
Learning rate is a tuning parameter in an optimization algorithm that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
